        "\n",
        "Bibliometric and scientometric analyses are common in many fields of research, being used for research assessment, i.e. the measurement of scholarly productivity and impact of institutions, journals, or individual scholars, or, alternatively, for science mapping, the empirical analysis of knowledge production in a particular field of scholarship [@vanRaan_2019]. However, this has not been the case for the field of German legal scholarship. One empirical indication of this state of affairs is that, when searching in the full texts of German law journal articles available on JSTOR for the expression \"bibliometr\\*\", there are exactly two hits.[^1]\n",
        "\n",
        "[^1]: For this ad-hoc experiment, a dataset has been created on constellate.org, consisting of metadata and fulltext of 45233 documents from the German law journals available on this platform: Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie, Archiv des öffentlichen Rechts, Archiv für Rechts- und Sozialphilosophie, Archiv für Rechts- und Wirtschaftsphilosophie, Archiv für die civilistische Praxis, Der Staat, KritV, Kritische Justiz, Rabels Zeitschrift für ausländisches und internationales Privatrecht, Zeitschrift für Rechtspolitik, in the period 1900-2023. These journals are not in any way representative for German legal scholarship, but it is unlikely that this sample would contain significantly fewer hits than any other sample of the same size from a complete corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason for this could be attributed to the fact that lawyers treat bibliometric analyses with skepticism. As the 2012 Report on the State of German Legal Scholarship and Education states: „Bibliometric methods are not sufficiently capable of measuring research performance in legal scholarship.“ [@germancouncilofscienceandhumanities2012, p. 54]. However, our suspicion is that this situation is equally, if not more so, due to the fact that unlike in other fields of science, there just isn't enough data available on which bibliometric analyses could be based upon.\n",
        "\n",
        "The purpose of this paper is to empirically test this proposition. It systematically investigates how the German landscape of law journals is represented in the databases used for bibliometric analyses, in particular the Web of Science, Scopus, and OpenAlex.\n",
        "\n",
        "This research question is subdivided in three sub-questions, which are discussed in separate parts of this paper after shortly surveying previous work. The *first question* asks what exactly we are looking for: what set of publications represents the German law journal landscape? Here, were are not aiming at completeness, but rather at a a sample that is sufficiently large and representative enough to make our observations valid. Based on a previous study that surveyed German law professors to construct a ranking of law journals [@gröls2009], we propose a \"gold standard\" list of German law journals. Once the sample has been established, the *second question* how much data exists for this sample in our target databases. The *third question* is about data quality: it is not enough to observe the pure quantity of records found for our sample - we also have to investigate how complete and accurate this data is, and what questions can be answered based on it, and which cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "Not surprisingly, we conclude that is that the data bears out the initial hypothesis. While the bibliometric coverage of knowledge production in the German legal domain is getting better in recent years, mainly because of the appearance of new players in the market, it is generally still very limited. As most German law journal do not fit the selection criteria of the commercial vendors, the more open offerings such as OpenAlex are the only viable candidate. However, the available metadata is found wanting. In particular, we observe a general lack of citation data. The conclusion sketches some reasons for why this is so and proposes ways forward.\n",
        "\n",
        "This paper is a interdisciplinary collaboration between two domain specialists and a bibliometrician, and thus tries to combine different epistemic interests: on one hand, in those questions that require the data we are looking for, and on the other, the questions that the data poses itself. We document all queries and the code we used to produce the tables and graphs in the following sections in our GitHub repository.[^2]\n",

        "## 2. Previous and related work\n",
        "\n",
        "As far as we can see, this is the first study of this kind. Earlier research had put its interest more in the way legal texts cite other legal material, such as the characteristics of references to legal provisions in judgments [@wagner-döbler1993] or the networks that can constructed from references between legal texts [@coupette2019]. For reasons that we will return to in the conclusion, the bibliometric analysis of legal scholarship itself has never become a subject of scholarly attention. In contrast, when looking outside the German legal domain, there have been numerous studies using bibliometric methods to analyze knowledge production of various disciplines, such as, for example of Digital Humanities [@tang2017] or Scientometrics itself [@liu2023].\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we have not been able to identify other studies - although they might exist - which measure the quality of the bibliometric data *on* a discipline, since, as we will see, this exercise requires data outside the traditional databases - some \"gold standard\" - against which they can be compared. In most cases, the data quality of databases such as the Web of Science or Scopus is simply assumed - a trust that might not be warranted, in particular in scientific fields where the coverage of these databases is sketchy. This has been empirically shown for the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) [@hicks1999; @gläser2019].\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, such studies point out that in the fields in SSH, a large part of the research is published as monographs or parts thereof. These publications are even less present in databases which focus on journals, the main form of scientific communication in the natural sciences [@hammarfelt2016]. This is also true for German legal scholarship. However, this plays no role for the analyses in this paper, as our explicit focus is on law journals.[^3]\n",
        "\n",
        "[^3]: The Research project \"Kulturwandel in der Rechtswissenschaft (KidRewi)\", which, among other things, investigates the presence of monographic legal scholarship in bibliometric databases (https://openrewi.org/kidrewi/).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Constructing a gold standard list of German law journals\n",
        "\n",
        "The first task in measuring the coverage of German law journals in bibliographic databases is to determine which of the journals to look for, i.e. to create a list of journals that represent the category \"German law journals\". In this endeavour, we do not aim for completeness. For the purpose of this study, it will suffice to have a sample which is sufficiently large to be representative of the field. At the same time, the selection must be small enough to be checked and enriched with additional metadata (for example, a persistent identifier such as the ISSN) with a reasonable amount of effort. This will allow us to define a list of journals for which, at a minimum, data has to exist in sufficient quality in order to make statements about knowledge production in German legal scholarship. This does not mean that journals that are not on the list are not important for the discipline. We make no statement on the difference of quality of those journals that make it on the list compared to those which do not. We are not interested in finding or providing a metric similar to the \"journal impact factor\" of German law journals. We are only interested in the quality of bibliometric data on a representative and relevant list of German law journals.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are generally two ways in which such a list could be assembled. One approach requires no prior knowledge of the field and promises an \"objective\" way of generating a list. This *data-based* approach relies on the presence of databases which have sufficiently good metadata categories. It seems not unreasonable to assume that, given a database of journals which has labels for the subject matter \"law\" and the language attribute \"German\", one would be able derive a list of German law journals. This would include all journals with German language content, i.e., include journals from Germany, Austria, Switzerland and other legal publications in German. This list could then be filtered further down to journals that cover the Federal Republic of Germany or any other country or combinations of countries. However, as we will discuss below, even if this would work, such an approach will always have at least two problems: a) an additional metric would be needed that would allow to limit this list to the really relevant and representative journals and, even more important, b) the list might be affected by a selection bias in the data from which it was derived. We will therefore argue that we need an alternative approach wich is *based on domain expert knowledge* and which might be more reliable for our purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data-based selection\n",
        "\n",
        "In the following, we will test, first, the German journal database (Zeitschriftendatenbank), and afterwards the bibliometric databases Web of Science, Scopus and OpenAlex as a source for deriving our list.\n",

        "\n",
        "In order to test this approach, we ran a query using these parameters, using the [lobid.org](https://lobid.org) linked-data gateway to the ZDB, resulting in a list of 7406 journals. Many of these journals are historic and do not matter for our analysis. Limiting the time period to after 1945, we still count 1692 journals. @fig-zdb shows a plot of the number of journals being actively published in any given year between 1945 and 2023. However, many of them represent publications that would not qualify as \"law journals\", for example, local administrative gazettes or other official publications."

        "Instead, the next experiment was to probe the bibliometric databases themselves to see whether, based on the available metadata, we could generate a methodologically controlled list of journals. In theory, this could yield a better selection than what we retrieved from the ZDB, since the bibliometric databases aim to focus on research and are less likely to contain non-scholarly communications. The reason for this selection of these three databases (and the exclusion of others, such as Lens, Semantic Scholar or dimension.ai) is that they are available in a normalized schema, at the Kompetenznetzwerk Bibliometrie (Schmidt et al. 2024).[^4]\n",
        "\n",
        "[^4]: Up until recently, trying to query these bibliometric databases comparatively would have been a major challenge, since the raw data looks very different for WoS, Scopus and OpenAlex. WoS and Scopus raw data comes in XML and is item-centric, meaning meta data on, for example, journals, author and institutions is available, but only as part of the item xml files. In contrast, OpenAlex raw data is provided in JSONL files and organized in entities and relations between them. This means we would have had to write a different query for each data source. However, since the KB bibliometric database store the data in a common, normalized schema, it allows to use the same, or very similar queries to execute against the data sources (The normalized metadata schema cannot be 100% identical because the differences in the source data). It thus provides an extremely efficient infrastructure for comparisons between them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to achieve our goal of creating a list of German law articles, we have to define queries to execute on each data source. In terms of classification each source uses a different system: WoS and Scopus use journal-level classifications, assigned to the item in the XML files, whereas OpenAlex provides an item-specific classification.[^5] Language is item-specific in all three databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "[^5]: We used the classification system \"ASCA (American School Counselor Association) traditional\" for WoS and \"ASJC (All Science Journal Classification)\" for Scopus. OpenAlex comes with its own item-specific hierarchical classification system (from high to low: domain, field, subfield, topic; see https://docs.openalex.org/api-entities/topics). We used the subfield level.\n",
        "\n",
        "We wanted to find journals which have article items that belong to the \"law\" category in the respective classification system, and of which the majority of articles are flagged as being in German. The selection criteria we chose was that a journal would be considered part of our sample if at least 10 articles had a subject category: Law **and** if at least 10% were classified as \"Law\" and \"German\". We chose to have both restrictions here because there are some exceptional cases of journals with a very low number of articles, which points to gaps or errors in the data. We therefore did not want to include these exceptional cases where a very few German law articles would already fulfil the quota.\n",

In short, their study consists of different rankings of german law journals generated by surveying the individual assessment of german law scholars. First, 1500 email addresses of german law professors, both current and former, as well as research associates were identified by reviewing the webpages of 45 german universities and academic institutions. Next, these individuals were contacted via email and asked to fill out the survey. 248 responses were received, marking a 16,5% response rate.\n",

Journals over a certain counting threshold were then assigned scores based on their place in the participants ranking as well as the participants academic status (professors were weighted stronger than research associates) and ‘expert factor’, thus creating two different kinds of rankings: one for journals considered general in nature and several others according to specific subdisciplines.\n",

Specifically, there could be the risk of missing relevant journals established after 2009 or not accounting for the fact that more recent rankings would vastly diverge from one fifteen years ago. In fact, for domain experts it seems an obvious problem that journals as e.g. Rechtswissenschaft (est. 2010) or Recht und Zugang (est. 2020), are necessarily not included in our Gold Standard set and thus are not part of our study.\n",

First, similar to the situation described by Gröls/Gröls in 2009, there is simply not much alternative research to be found that would be more recent and at least equally suited for a gold standard. In other words, having the risk of incomplete data is more favorable than no data at all. Second, we assume the market for german law journals to be a fairly static one, thus deeming it highly likely that a more recent ranking would more or less include the same publications as fifteen years ago, with the exception of the above mentioned journals.\n",

Our search returned journals having the feature \"law\" and \"German\", but with no indication of their quality or impact. In contrast, our Gold Standard is based on their perceived 'relevance' among the population of legal scholars in the survey. In standard bibliometric analysis, the 'impact factor' would be derived by measuring the number of references to articles in that journal (citation count).

We then compared the order of the journals ranked by these metrics with that of the gold standard, with mixed results. <mark>Das folgende braucht eine Tabelle und nochmal eine Überarbeitung</mark>When results show that the pure works count shows a max rank of 299 for a gold standard journal, bad (while the top 5 have ranks 1,2,3,7 and 8 which is good), also both citation based methods provide high ranks for many gold standard journals.

However, a closer examination revealed a striking pattern: the majority of missing articles (58 out of 67) were from the publication year 2022. This suggests a potential issue with the timing of data updates in OpenAlex. Specifically, we observed instances where a DOI or item was present in a more recent OpenAlex snapshot, but was missing from an earlier snapshot. For example, the DOI '10.1628/acp-2022-0013' was not present in the August 2024 snapshot, but was included in the November 2024 snapshot. This highlights the importance of considering the timing of data updates when analyzing bibliometric data."

It is to expected that such item types do not have authors, although the fact that they have been classified as 'article' in the publisher data as well as OpenAlex data raises some doubts. Equally, the practice of giving the review section one single DOI has to be criticized from a bibliometric perspective, regardless of whether publishers add the authors of the review articles or not.

The x-axis corresponds to the difference, the y-axis the number of articles with this difference. So the ideal case would be all the journals having one only value at x=0, showing for all their articles there is an equal number of authors in OpenAlex and the publisher data.

        "The last metric we want to have a look at is a ranking of journals based on the available data in our gold standard. If we assume that the expert assessment is the best data we have, what can we draw on in OpenAlex that could be compared to it? The typical metric that is used in the traditional bibliometric databases is the Journal Impact Factor (JIF)[@garfield1999], which despite being heavily criticized [@archambault2009], is still widely used. Calculating the JIF for the gold standard journals in OpenAlex is problematic since we are lacking data for many years. Also the question is for what year to compare it - since the gold standard is from 2009, it would make sense to compare the JIF only for 2009. However, given that a) as we have argued before, the German legal landscape is very static and b) there is very little data to rely on, it made sense to calculate the JIF over all available data. Our aim is not an exact comparison but rather meant to give a sense of how much the OpenAlex ranking differs from the gold standard one.\n",

        "We compared the Gröls/Gröls ranking with the JIF-based ranking from OpenAlex separatedly for the generalist journals (@fig-comp-groels-jif-general) and the specialized ones (@fig-comp-groels-jif-specialized). Looking at the results, the rankings differ considerably."

        "Our aim was to examine the coverage of German-language, more specifically, Germany-based law journals in the Web of Science, Scopus and OpenAlex bibliometric databases. In order to do that, we derived a list of law journals (our gold standard) from a study that had surveyed German law professors about which journals they considered most important in their field. We then queried the three data sources for the coverage of these journals. A closer analysis of metadata quality in OpenAlex has shown that \\[...\\].\n",

        "::: callout-important\n",
        "Daniel, kannst Du mit eigenen Worten die Ergebnisse zusammenfassen?\n",
        ":::\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking at our results, it is clear that OpenAlex is the only of the bibliometric databases examined which currently has a minimal coverage of German law journals as far as our gold standard set is representative. It offers a limited, but steadily growing basis for bibliometric queries. Our analysis confirms studies which have argued that WoS or Scopus are, as Tenant has expressed it, \"structurally biased against \\[...\\] non-English language research\" [@tennant2020, p.1], although Tenant was specifically referring to research in \"non-western countries.\" The case of German law journals is certainly a bit different, not only because Germany is part of the \"Western\" hemisphere in terms of knowledge production.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is beyond the scope of this article to systematically analyze the reasons for the neglect of German law in the bibliometric databases. However, it is reasonable to assume that at least two factors are at play. The first concerns the non-universality of legal scholarship irrespective of language: as the law is specific to national jurisdictions, much of doctrinal legal scholarship is by nature not transferable to other jurisdiction. This makes all non-common law doctrinal knowledge uninteresting to database vendors focused on an Anglo-American audience. Second, the strict selection criteria of WoS and Scopus is premised on a particularly peer-review and publishing model which does not fit the way German legal scholarship is being produced, reviewed, and published. These selection criteria would have to be changed in order to accurately reflect knowledge production in a wider array of scholarly domains.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the future of bibliometric analyses should not be dependent on these vendors, who sell their metadata at high costs and with restrictive licenses. As we have shown, open suppliers such as OpenAlex already have a better, but still very limited coverage of the German legal domain.\n",

        "\n",
        "From our experiments, we draw a few conclusions for future research.\n",
        "\n",
        "First of all, as OpenAlex's data repository is highly dynamic, it is necessary to continually follow its growth and internal refactoring and repeat the queries from this study in order to document improvements of the coverage of the gold standard across database versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, relying solely on publishers to supply the necessary data will not suffice. In particular, it is improbable that the current near-complete absence of citation data will be resolved in the near future. On one hand, some publishers may have a vested interest in monetizing citation data. However, even if they are open to sharing citation data in principle, such data often simply does not exist. This is especially true in the German academic realm, where no machine-readable citation data is being gathered or generated during the publication process.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, current tools for citation extraction [@cioffi2022] are performing very badly when confronted with citations in legal scholarship (and the humanities).[^26] The reason is that they have been trained on data from the natural sciences, which usually contain well-structured bibliographies. In contrast, references in German legal scholarship usually relies on literature contained in footnotes, which are very difficult to parse computationally. This is arguably also one of the main causes why such few citation data is available for this domain (and similar ones). However, with the recent emergence of Large Language Models, which are able to interpret semantic structures based on the context, this is likely to change.\n",

        "The research community should therefore take the matter in its own hands and invest energy (and money) into developing the tools to do citation mining by themselves. Once easy-to-use tools are available, it is possible to to create, in a decentralized and incremental process, Open Data datasets that are necessary to study knowledge production in legal scholarship and beyond.\n",
